Hello guys, This is Dharmesh Mourya.
And today i will show you how to upload file using spring mvc using maven.
so for that we will need to create one maven project in eclipse.
so here we go search for the maven project
this one, last one maven and chose your work location.
my work location is  F://Eclipse-Project . 
click on next button and go to the end and select webapp.
click on next button and Group ID: this is like package name 
I will give com.spring.fileupload and Artifact ID is like 
our project name so SpringMVCFileUpload is our project name.
and click on finish button...
And now expand the project, here we are
getting an error, expand src folder here if "java" 
folder is not located in the src folder then we need to create it by your own.
Now we will add dependencies for our pom.xml.
here already one dependency has added but for sping mvc we need to add spring related dependencies 
and servlet-api, jsp-api and jstl related etc dependencies also.
so for the dependencies go to the https://mvnrepository.com website
and copy the spring related all the dependencies.
here i am searching spring transaction, so here we'll get all spring related dependencies.
